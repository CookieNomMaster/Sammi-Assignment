        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>I have interest in gaming. My favourite genre tends to be sandbox, strategy and/or role-playing games. My favourite game is Persona 5 Royal which is a JRPG. I enjoy watching e-sports to see the amazing talent in some games and speedrunning to see how people are able to break games. Gaming is a good way for me to pass time and I especially enjoy when I play with friends as it makes even losing or failing fun.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>I enjoy listening to music to calm myself down or just to pass the time. I dont mind listening to any kind of music but I prefer more calming music like jazz or rock. Usually I have music play in the background while doing work or doing an assignment so I don't get bored and music helps me keep my focus. </p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>Of course, as a software development student, I would enjoy coding. I find it exhilarating to make code and trying to get it to work. This is why I hope to be a back-end developer as I find the code to be reasonable and non-complicated. I am able to do coding assignments in one sitting with my entire focus on it. </p>

        <h2>News</h2>
        <p>I enjoy conversing with others on new and updated topics in news or the world. Seeing how terrible the world has been recently, I enjoy talking to people about it to be more informed about the situations in the world. It also helps when some good news is ever mentioned as it shows that there is some hope in this conceringly horrendous world.</p>

    <div class="ih5">
    
        <h2>Anime and Shows</h2>
        <p>I enjoy watching shows and anime in my free time or with friends. Usually the shows are drama or comedy based, some being for nostalga and others being shows we have been suggested. I enjoy watching shows that are comedic and/or adventure based. I dont enjoy romance as the ideas are repetitive and bland at this point.</p>
