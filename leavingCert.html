        <h1>Leaving Certificate </h1>
        <p> The Leaving Certificate was an exam that feels like I had only done recently. Preparing my entire secondary school learning for the exam felt like a century however university has been quicker and more worth it. The subjects I had chose I enjoyed and did pretty well in. Due to the pandemic, my exam had to be modified to be lenient for us.</p>

        <h2>English</h2>
            <p>English is one of the three mandatory subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done the higher level version of the subject. English has us learn 4 texts and poems of poets while also writing essays on them. We also wrote essays on reading and personal questions on the exam. I had learnt for my single text A Doll's House, a book about women suffrage. I learnt Macbeth, (a Shakespearean play about Scotland) Room, (a mother and son escaping and adapting to society) and Ladybird (a movie of a girl learning the harsh reality of life). The poets and their poems that I learnt were W.B Yeats, Elizabeth Bishop, Emily Dickinson and Brendan Kennelly. I am glad of how I did in English and the questions during the two papers.</p>

        <h2>Maths</h2>
            <p>Maths is one of the three mandatory subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done the higher level version of the subject. Maths requires you to learn about statistics, differenciation, probability, financial maths, functions, trigonometry, sequences and series, co-ordinate geometry and complex numbers. The subject is split into 2 years with each paper being the topics you learnt about in the year. I didn't find maths difficult and understood every topic that was taught to me. I learnt the various technique and was quick at completing any questions that are given to me.</p>

        <h2> Irish </h2>
            <p>Irish is one of the three mandatory subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done both the higher and ordinary level of the subject. Irish has many similarities to English but toned back due to the language being spoken a lot less. You have an oral exam on the subject where you speak about yourself and personal life, say a poem, describe pictures and talk about your future. The written papers are split in two, one is personal essays and an aural, the other is learned material and grammar. I never enjoyed Irish classes however I enjoyed the language and I believe that is the only reason I tolerated the subject.</p>

        <h2> Biology </h2>
            <p>Biology is one of many optional subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done the higher level of the subject for the exam. Biology is about learning plants and animals and how they function. From the heart beating to the reproduction of species. We learn of the many different cells that are in the world and see the differences each have to one another as well as how they interact together to help each other survive. Most of biology is using learnt material to simplify answers and make it quick and coherent. When doing Biology, I found it to be long and boring due to the excessive material where half, of what is learnt, shows up</p>

        <h2> Physics </h2>
            <p>Physics is one of many optional subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done the higher level of the subject for the exam. Some of the key areas of physics that you'll study for the leaving certificate include mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics. In each of these areas, you'll learn about different concepts, equations, and experiments that help to explain how the world works. These are the fundamentals of the universe and helps us under why and how everything around us works. Physics was never confusing however, like Biology, it was long and topics tended to not show up.</p>

        <h2> Engineering </h2>
            <p>Engineering is one of many optional subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done the higher level of the subject for the exam. Engineering is the application of science and mathematics to solve real-world problems. It involves designing, building, and testing structures, machines, systems, and processes. Engineers use their knowledge of physics, mathematics, and materials science to create practical solutions to everyday challenges. Each topic is its own question so you can safely trust the topic will show up. There is always a question about the changes in the field of engineering. When doing the subject, I was impressed at my practical and theory abilities and never fell behind.</p>

        <h2> Applied Maths </h2>
            <p>Applied Maths is one of many optional subjects of the Leaving Certificate. I had done the higher level of the subject. Applied Maths is the study of using mathematical techniques to solve real-world problems. It involves taking complex real-life situations and breaking them down into mathematical models that can be analyzed and solved using a range of mathematical tools and techniques. Applied Maths covers a range of topics, including mechanics, statistics, calculus, and numerical methods. When I had gone through the subject, I found it difficult at the start but slowly started to learn of methods which made the subject easier to do.</p>
