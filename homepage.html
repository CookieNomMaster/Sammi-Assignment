        <h1> Samiur Kazi </h1>
        <p>My name is MD Samiur Rahman Kazi. You can call me Samiur, Sammi or by my user, Cookie. I am Irish, born in Cork and bred in Clare, and residing in Shannon Town.</p>
        <p>I am a student in TUS Midwest (formally known as LIT) studying in the course of a Honours BSc in Software Development. Although not my first pick, I am enjoying this course and the path it is taking me.</p>
        <p>I hope that this page and the next few show you my skills and passion in my work and the activities I do. I also hope they attempt to convince you that I may be a good choice to hire. </p>
