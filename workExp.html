        <h1>Tasty Pizza</h1>
        <p> I had spent a bit of time working at Tasty Pizza here in Shannon for some work experience during the June of 2021. I helped package and make food. I learnt that you have to keep an eye on what is happening even if it is timed as something may go wrong.</p>

        <h1> McDonald's - Shannon</h1>
        <p>I would work the many different stations in the restaurant. I would make patties, fries, chicken and drinks. I would also take and serve customers. I learnt a lot of how teamwork and communication is very important to make sure that the food is made perfectly for the customer and given at a reasonable time without them waiting for a long time.</p>
