        <h1>My Education</h1>
        <p>Since I had not lived my whole life in one place, I have changed schools. Until I got to Shannon, I wouldn't really establish many friends due to worry of never talking to them again. However once I started to stay in one spot, I started to improve myself and make a few friends which I still have.</p>

        <h2>Clonakilty</h2>
            <p>I attended Scoil na mBuachailli in Clonakilty. I only attended 2 years so I don't remember anything nor do I have many reason to ever go back. </p>

        <h2> Shannon </h2>
            <p>I attended St. Aidans National School here in Shannon. I went through 3rd class until the end of 6th class where I left for my secondary school.</p>

        <h2> St. Patrick's Comprehensive School</h2>
            <p>This is the secondary school that I went through from the start of Junior Cert to the end of the Leaving Cert. It is a non-uniform school so I never had to wear an uncomfortable uniform. The years I spent here allowed me to learn a lot about myself and have gathered me a few friends which I still have today.</p>

        <h2> TUS, Moylish Campus </h2>
            <p>Currently I am in the Technological University of the Shannon (TUS) studying a bachelors in Software Development as I had mentioned before. Attending Moylish Campus can be annoying due to the inconsistent bus rides and sometimes the long days however I enjoy the hands-on approach that this university has taken.</p>
